.Sh NAME
.Nm kitten
.Nd concatenate and print files as if we were a 
.Xr cat 1 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl benstuv
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.
.Nm
decidedly promotes the useless use of 
.Xr cat 1 .
The
.Ar file
operands are processed in command-line order.
If
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq \&-
or absent,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
If
.Ar file
is a
.Ux
domain socket,
.Nm
connects to it and then reads it until
.Dv EOF .
This complements the
.Ux
domain binding capability available in
.Xr inetd 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.
.It Fl e
Display non-printing characters (see the
.Fl v
option), and display a dollar sign
.Pq Ql \&$
at the end of each line.
.It Fl n
Number the output lines, starting at 1.
.It Fl s
Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
single spaced.
.It Fl t
Display non-printing characters (see the
.Fl v
option), and display tab characters as
.Ql ^I .
.It Fl u
Disable output buffering.
.It Fl v
Display non-printing characters so they are visible.
Control characters print as
.Ql ^X
for control-X; the delete
character (octal 0177) prints as
.Ql ^? .
.Pf Non- Tn ASCII
characters (with the high bit set) are printed as
.Ql M-
(for meta) followed by the character for the low 7 bits.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
.Dl "cat file1"
.Pp
will print the contents of
.Ar file1
to the standard output.
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
.Dl "cat file1 file2 > file3"
.Pp
will sequentially print the contents of
.Ar file1
and
.Ar file2
to the file
.Ar file3 ,
truncating
.Ar file3
if it already exists.
See the manual page for your shell (i.e.,
.Xr sh 1 )
for more information on redirection.
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
.Dl "cat file1 - file2 - file3"
.Pp
will print the contents of
.Ar file1 ,
print data it receives from the standard input until it receives an
.Dv EOF
.Pq Sq ^D
character, print the contents of
.Ar file2 ,
read and output contents of the standard input again, then finally output
the contents of
.Ar file3 .
Note that if the standard input referred to a file, the second dash
on the command-line would have no effect, since the entire contents of the file
would have already been read and printed by
.Nm
when it encountered the first
.Ql \&-
operand.

.Re
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is probably not compliant with the
.St -p1003.2-92
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl benstv
are extensions to the specification.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Xr cat 1 
utility appeared in
.At v1 .
.An Dennis Ritchie
designed and wrote the first man page.
It appears to have been
.Xr cat 1 .
.Sh BUGS
Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output
redirection, the command
.Dq Li cat file1 file2 > file1
will cause the original data in file1 to be destroyed!
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility does not recognize multibyte characters when the
.Fl t
or
.Fl v
option is in effect.
